			<p>Competitive exams help to determine the initial career path,as getting success in these exams needs learning about logical reasoning,aptitude and the subject 
			field itself.It gives a chance to students to understand what to expect in that particular field.</p>
			<p>The purpose of competitive exams is not only to judge  your talent but also to test your management and planing skills.The whole concept of any competitive
			exams is based on strategic thinking and smart work.</p>
			<p>Being successful on any exam not only involves preparation and utilization of resources,it is also indirectly linked to the candidates confidence level.Having 
			confidence helps dispel test anxiety caused by fear and uncertainty of the subject material.The more prepared candidates are ,the more confident they become.</p> 
			<p>Early exposure to learning and competition builds confidence and sharpens skills which raise your level from other students on the same platform.</p>
			<p>Competitive exams also help out in choosing a career as students start identifying their areas of interest while getting a deeper knowledge of subjects.</p>
			<p>There are no drawbacks of appearing for such competitive exams and it's just a myth that they can hamper regular studies. An early step will articulate your journey of success.</p>
